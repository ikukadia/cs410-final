i'm so scared oh you mean the correct thing? for everyone omar can you send the lab should i change @aishik ghosh can u make me coffee pls ask acm i doubt it everyone is here lol jeff gerickson on taking 421&374 together
"you should ask the 421 instructors for a definitive opinion, but i wouldnât recommend this unless you are already _very_ comfortable with recursion and induction. (the specifics of regular and context-free languages/grammars are less of an issue.)" yikes they probably gave it to too many people 421 sounds fun so is omar but why did aishik get approved wait fr? i should have submitted smh wow sad what the i got cohort restriction for 374 ok all that's left is 425 and 374 u can always take 433 later right he has work but he said he might get someone to cover for him i saw shallom and it's his birthday today so when he mentioned how he might come over at 5 i just told him were going rock climbing then why is registering for classes harder now than it was a year ago i have cohort restriction on all my classes except for 411 which one do i pick do u think it's cause i registered for 4 credit version for 425 it says level restriction? did wade ever open a crn there's only 5 seats remaining for wednesday 3 lmao why are 374 discussion classes so small lmao 212 is playing the country song i mean i'll be here regardless of what happens yeah we could do that if rock climbing is happening at 4 elaboration: i've slept 4,6,6 hours the last 3 nights and i've come to learn that even hearing whispers keeps me up proposal: no one comes over until 3 so i can nap after music if it is odd omar said he doesn't care if he works alone âµ i stg i heard an elevator pass me on it's way down even tho i called it called it they had a quiz friday it's prolly fine lmao don't they always release it sunday there's men like yodeling in my music class rn and thus was more likely to confuse me w someone just realized akshaya must have seen that i said i was interested in the music event on fb so she was prolly looking for me in the crowd or smth i specifically didn't pick like 2 answers cause i was like well i can't pick c again can y'all go to sleep soon pls what the ð¤ my only friends ð¤ unless lol that was most certainly not me go join their party there were so many moms at red lion i'm shaken âµ pls can someone come help me setup lol room 3401 kids y wow lmao 0220 cause it's lunch so people will prolly be late wow so basically i'm the only one not in the basement lol since y'all don't answer my question
data structures 12 room 0220
glsl 2 room 0220 âµ so basically @omar mbarki and @irdina nadeem/@aishik ghosh webdev: 3 pm in 0224
hackathons: 4 pm in 3401 everyone send what time their class for sail is and what room idk i saw it on fb right that's what i'm saying no i think it's fr nothing ever happens on fridays why meanwhile my hackathon class has been at 10 since day 1 pls this full house why i saw bus went wrong and thought it was a 241 email it's karma it heard me say i wanted chipotle ðð¼ðð¼ðð¼ ad[dick]ted set the emoji to âµ. at the same time i'd rather both hm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryzjouunlu&feature=share what lol i didn't check my work cause i saw omar leave and i got spooked omg @ omar his anthem is gummo avdjshd my two brain cells during these exams also do you have to know named pipes is it true that offset can be calculated by the page size yeah she said it was fine she got an 86 when it's ok are you going to grainger today does anyone have a scientific calculator they only know true culture is that akshaya lmao ð thx icic ohhh but the thing i'm confused about is how does everyone pick up the left fork when locks are thread safe and it wouldn't be locked by more than one process at a time but i thought the whole point of locks is like even if u lock at the same time as another thread, one will acquire the lock while the other waits wdym if every thread attempts to grab left that means 1 thread will successfully grab left and then eat and release left
eventually everyone would get their locks and finish fine kids why does this deadlock does the extra mean i don't need to know it so 3 photos of omar apr 13 cause i have class and me too psa chai and chat on the quad tomorrow at 11-2 there's holi tickets for $8 instead of $11 people are posting bt it on piazza a was on left no i got 50/80 but there's no way what the there's maize oh are rn isn't his office in siebel remember to come to siebel today at 4 to talk to wade elaine and omar wade's oh are tomorrow 3:30-5 let's go then to talk about 497 that's good i wasn't gonna send it until i heard that right!! that's funny https://www.instagram.com/p/bvk31jva3ny/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=rwx79pow3nch actually jk i got that wrong too what the what the lmao http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/promo https://twitter.com/ecareyo/status/1111447945251971074 cowabhangra cowabunga ðð½ââï¸ ð he's literally at scott my note to myself to not do the hackathon class anymore that i forgot to look at ajdjshd my internal clock knows too much and like dream me was like no way my alarms about to go off but then it did my brain is so mean to me. i dreamt of a voice being like "oh you're comfortable?

laptop until i had to upgrade to 10 for ubuntu if i had xp originally i wouldn't oh let me pour glue on this perfectly constructed vase why fix what's not broken i wouldn't know bc i don't update because i'm not taking any risks i haven't updated instagram in forever or tumblr or reddit no i won't i want to choose whe they come but sometimes updates are bad no updating when there's not a problem is and always will be useless i had to last night tho i don't update my app it's changing too much i don't like change ð i hate it exactly why does the color on messenger change take that you whores wait maybe i'm not sick cause i got the flu shot yeah we have class rn until 2 at siebel so we're already here is anyone meeting us here do we need to wait for anyone he's just like you it doesn't have to be some formal presentation guys we're just gonna keep him updated so he feels good yeah that's what i was thinking idk suhi thinks it's a good idea i imagine she knows more about what's good idk we talked to him at 4 pm on a tuesday i think he was there but remember he was there on a tuesday idk but suhi said he'd be there we're visitn ghis office no siebel right just don't touch anything especially cause i think he must've been dissapointed when we didn't present i agree our class ends at 2 anyways if more people are able to meet irdina and i at siebel i think we should just drop by and at the very least give  small update to him like today we have an excuse to not have worked on it more idk i just feel like seeing him in a week is tragic bc it's like oh the hackathon was so long ago and we did nothing since then if we want to just drop by today irdina and i will be at siebel at 2 i don't think if getting all of us to go means not going until much much later omar are u missing discussion and then i said non sick people can go i know oh lol but the point was to show him our progress idk it would mean more to him to the non sick people can go aw but i thought it'd be better to do in person do it on my account so i get full points how long does it to take to grill something are they using a candle flame to heat it up actually going on 12 min this better be the best sandwich ever i waited 10 min for a sandwich to get grilled at espresso royale does anyone know which lecture is the last one for the quiz let's play a game called can alvina watch

? students r dumb lol so is the move for me to leave it or fix it i get 5/5 and i just ran it so what the ð which is bad for me cause i did not implement bg i think they just didn't fix the tests yet wait u owe me 100 what did u change lol wow it quits the shell if i don't i know why i have it wait ok cause omar had it on like the first day so i didn't know i had it originally for ctrl c but like since we fixed that idk what this line is for do you guys still have this if signal line or is it fake lol what about if it's like echo hi && !history only bc my code is so wet so when i changed it one place i needed to change it a billion other places is this right for commands you should push back? it should say it all together correct wait no just to confirm, if you do x && y, and then you do !history, it should say x on one line and y on the next? works for me lol he's saying he's not getting the last point mine's the same wow do u wanna compare w mine since u probs did it the same way as me i don't use fgets i can't send mine you'll actually cry omar i don't want your hand i may be failing this mp but at least i have support thanks guys âð¼ someone hold my hand guys i'm nervous this man just ignores all my requests i'm so sad ok i've got even more incentive i'll do ur stats for mp help i pass all the file tests i'll help u if u help me ð do i have to send the gif again omar mbarki you are calling me tonight to help me w this mp it's over did you get 29 wait so i was right 29 me watching all these kids talking about things i need to fix while my code low key segfaults now pls get the hundo so you can help me lol wait why would mashing keys be new lines in your history file i feel like i'll need to call u later cause none of this makes sense to me lol hmm btw omar run ur autograder for mini_valgrind i don't wanna change anything unless its confirmed did you make these changes i feel like omar just says things so literally only when waitpid's status is -1 does failing but still running ur second command qualify? this guy is so bad at explaining things my question is in command1 || echo hi, what would command1 be that would fail that would still run echo hi when does that happen do you think our definition of what a fail is is fake ^ that's not good oh lol cause it's like running one command and then another independently lol i thought ; means if one fails it fails overall i feel like no but idk i thought you run the second one if the first one fails every time i need to change smth it breaks everything else omg right i have so many things to fix me maybe if they didn't have a billion things to implement in this mp they wouldn't have such a hard time keeping their requirements straight yikes and then hours later asked omar if commands had to be separate or on the same line wow imagine i looked at this very post yesterday but i didn't read it i just laughed at hung's answer classic hung ð post on powerrow what are those cheetos wow aishik talking about cravings wow why did you uber it's not even that cold my bus driver pulled into a gas station so i was like ok we're getting gas but then he pulled into the parking lot and went into the mcdonald's and came back with a coffee lmao but i didn't even implement it where is this bus @suhirtha raj who wants to get me dessert while i wait in this line i went on his dogemaster one and all his comments are downvoted lmaoo wow bailey made a second reddit account called btin99 im so sad these morsels of panda i'm still hungry lol im offended what other group is she in to talk about 241 excuse me because next weekend is birthday and then hackillinois ad[dick]ted set the emoji to ð. it would have to be march honestly this is omar with maryam ð½ but he's a liar omar keeps saying it's nbd omg i was at like 8000s before and im at 25k now kids is it normal for your pid to keep increasing i c most of us just didn't get that far omar is using vector i mean i feel like that's fine lol but i was gonna go home saturday morning maybe fanschy we should go to dinner friday i can hear omar's voice in my head "everything in c is in c++" wow if only they had a c intern position i'd shine i couldn't have gotten the 9 without u isha i think i just continue pay elaine im ready for this scalding tea what smh rohan asked us all to come over on wednesday and be there at midnight for his birthday i meant to send that to elaine shut lmaooo yw what if i follow wade omar mbarki to this day: reading and not replying omar mbarki literally 20 minutes ago: i reply to people when they have questions if no one disagrees with that rule i'm gonna assume it's yes so i can follow people username is powerrow pass is chiefonion but the good ones not like random neuqua kids it's been too long how i'm tryna be ð®ð® that's weird no isha when are you coming over excuse me come so you can get the free taco too do you think lyft from 212->taco bell <$10 i bet everyone is gonna do that today lyft there lyft back okay we can go later what the or are you busy do you wanna go now cause i'm a 7 min walk away right i'm so confused by all three of these messages someone go to taco bell with me y'all find me a beat that goes harder than this

executed_prog_name parameter_one parameter_two etc cause like it's like you're executing ./program_name execution_prog_name parameter i get it duh oh lol what the idk i think angrave just makes a lot of small mistakes i thought argv[0] is the process name and argv[1] is the first parameter if it exists 233** wow cannot wait for aishik to rain his intelligence on 410 down on me ad[dick]ted started sharing video. that's so cute we woke up at the same time nvm oh oh i didn't realize it was about god lol what i love her lolol what is she saying i need context elaine ahfkahd wade accepted my friend request ðð but our electric bill wow i'm heading to the ap they def laughed at you lol they laughed at omar when he was talking to the class maybe they're not so bad after all about the killing 1 person or killing 5 babies car problem whatever "dude we have to kill the babies what if there's gng affiliation" you're not funny you don't now them they're just really cringey like keep talking about how this class is useless and ethics are useless and feeling proud of themselves for thinking like that my group i'm talking with in 210 is the biggest group of stereotypical cs dude bros i've ever seen im so sad right when i decided music lecture isn't worth going to anymore, they start making it mandatory nothing is more depressing than choosing to not wait for the bus and having that very bus pass you on your walk wow i love angrave cause every time he makes a mistake he turns it into a lesson as if he planned it to happen no flaws right what i be watching instead of angrave

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t6w4n_gkkm&feature=share rude angrave writing down a method name and saying "i think it's called that. we'll find out in a moment" before he makes is such a mood we innit oh shit me too elaine she said she watched it on repeat knew how iconic it was even sriya lol bailey posted on his snap an email about getting a technical interview for a company he didn't apply for he doesn't even know aishik's powers rejections everywhere 5% acceptance rate why am i getting this 3 weeks into the semester omar: he didn't but i think the person above him who manages mus 133 did meanwhile my music professor mr "don't complain about a $200 book" is probably gonna be like "just wear a coat people in antarctica do it so can you" "breezy" look at how much the temp is dropping in 2 days might as well not go ur class is in 14 min ð hmmm what if i touch it and it's not yours wait is it your egg thing fake what is that suhi but they don't even go to loyola like when it gets warmer i mean in the summer omg yes m o v e i was too scared to open messenger lol there was a guy in front of me who had google hangouts chat open and that could also be a move so we have to see how helpful review will be although we'd miss review better to go than not go but what if they change things up im telling u it's da move thumbs up this comment if u think we should have 1 diff person go in every week and the rest of us go to like the atrium and work together no one supported my plan meanwhile i studied and still failed yeah i got that wrong cause i didn't read far enough to see the word relevant next quiz u all need to carry me bc im sitting at a 62 :'( + the first question im so sad guys i didn't look closely enough at the questions so i made two dumb mistakes lol cod had a snow day but actually make sure we all are in siebel outside the class so if they change things up we can go in each week a diff person goes i think the move is to hundo p have 1 person  go in every week and have the rest of us outside working together idk which one u mean yall i did bad sdnkjafk 3,2 2 yeah boi yeah and you could also see that [0] and [254] are "" yeah yeah that's why i got 2/16 yesterday for "" make sure u don't say (result==null) but rather (*result == null) idk cause most of these are from my brain lol i didn't change much from last night just one of my tests was wrong if u use pls change i don't want to die "hey whats. up you. guys"

started she said she'd ask questions as in plural lol and both were harder than mine mine was so ez but elaine was asked two (2) questions ð¤ logic is sound cause she kept correcting my problems lol no she only asked one cause i spent too long on it we finished 15 min early and she was like the rest of the time can be spent asking me any questions but i had no questions i just vaguely asked her abt her project and then asked what responsibilities interns have and that was it goodbye remember when i spent 30 min on the easiest question she had to tell me to make a last variable cause i was doing it wrong lol look @ this i'm sad the question was ezpz too it was only checking a palindrome but i kept forgetting things i def did bad i was only asked one question cause i think i spent too much time on it thank you ð fake what if i'm sad and alone and need a hug wait will you guys come over at 5 i'll do my best i was into it i did that for my 211 final and then still did bad omg
